Plotting functionality on `NDCube` has been refactored to use pluggable
"plotter" classes. All plotting functionality can now be accessed via the
`.NDCube.plotter` attribute, with `.NDCube.plot` becoming an alias for
`.NDCube.plotter.plot`.

Advanced users, or package maintainers that which to customise the plotting
functionality of an ``NDCube`` instance can set the ``.plotter`` attribute of
a cube to be a subclass of `ndcube.visualization.BasePlotter` which then
customises the behaviour of the ``NDCube.plot()`` method and provides any other
methods implemented on the plotter.
