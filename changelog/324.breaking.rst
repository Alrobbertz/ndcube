Change NDCube crop and crop_by_values APIs to accept two iterables of real world coordinates defining the lower and upper edges of the region of interest two which the NDCube will be cropped.  This replaces the intervals API where the upper and lower limit of each world coordinate was entered separately.  This cuts down on ambiguity in how the world coordinates are translated to a region of the NDCube.
